# Alerting
A hyprland project that alerts the user when their battery is low by changing the borders of windows.

This program uses color interpolation to change the color of active or inactive (or both), windows to represent the current battery percentage.

## Legal Licensing
Can you use this for your project? Yes, you can as long as you keep your own project under the same license (I think, read the license).

## Mathematical interpolation
The used interpolation method can be by editing the `interpolation_nth_degree.sh` script, or by simply changing the reference in the `int compile_calculate(int a, int b, int n, int t)` function located in the `precompile.c` file. The default color interpolation is applied individually on every color value (red, green and blue) based on a scaled parametric function where `t` is within the range [1,100] instead of [0,1]. The default interpolation is a function of Nth degree, where N can be modified by editing the `config_interpolation_degree` value of the configuration file (see Configuring section). It follows the rule: (T^N)((B-A)/(100^N))+A, where A is the starting color, B is the final color, N is the interpolation degree, and T is the parametric value ranging from 1 to 100.

### Preview Color Transition
This will be added later.

## Configuring
You want to change the colors, your hyprland configuration is located in the weirdest place possible? You aren't even using hyprland and are modifiying this to fit for your needs? The config file will help you with whatever you are doing. Feel free to modify it to your desires!

All values are explained in the `alerting.ini` configuration file, but you may want these comments gone for clarity of your settings, so here is a copy of the descriptions (with more details!).

| Values | Descriptions | Default Values |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| config_start_r | The amount of red in the beginning color -- when the battery is sitting at 100%. | 111 |
| config_start_g | The amount of green in the beginning color -- when the battery is sitting at 100%. | 201 |
| config_start_b | The amount of blue in the beginning color -- when the battery is sitting at 100%. | 141 |
| config_end_r | The amount of red in the beginning color -- when the battery reaches 0%. | 181 |
| config_end_g | The amount of green in the beginning color -- when the battery reaches 0%. | 4 |
| config_end_b | The amount of blue in the beginning color -- when the battery reaches 0%. | 10 |
| config_offset | Shifts the value of an index. For example, with an offset of 1, the value at T=1 is what would have been T=0, at T=50, T=49, etc. | 1 |
| config_interpolation_degree | The degree argument passed to the script for precompiling the interpolation between colors. | 5 |
| segment_header | The beginning section of the precompiled script. | %h#!/bin/bash<br>%h# File generated by precompile.c<br>%hcase "$1" in |
| segment_repeated | The section of the precompiled script that is repeated for each value of T from 1 to 100. The % & $ # symbols are used as formatting: % is replaced with the respective value of T, & is replaced with the hexadecimal red value at T, $ is replaced with the hexadecimal green value at T, and # is replaced with the hexadecimal blue value at T. | %r"%")<br>%r  echo "0xff&$#"<br>%r  ;; |
| segment_footer | The final section of the precompiled script used for the case of a wrong input. | %f*)<br>%f  echo "0xff000000"<br>%f  ;;<br>%fesac |
